MultiGeneratorPaperReport plugin for OCS allows conference managers to generate full publications' reports (sched. conf. sections, articles, abstracts, and so on) in many output formats.  
So far, the plugin supports CSV, HTML and DOC format, but it can be easily extended to other formats (ej. PDF, ODT, ODP...). To that end, an extensible class hierarchy has been
set up, in which the report generation was based on the "template method" pattern. For example (to summarize this idea):

- PaperReportHandler class defines all basic functions required to implement a new generator (begin report, process data and end report).
- PaperReportHTML is a concrete implementation of PaperReportHandler
- PaperReportDOC is a specification of PaperReportHTML (doc output is based on HTML output, and it's basically the same output with slight changes).


This plugin has been designed, implemented and tested by Agust√≠n Terruzzi and Gonzalo L. Villarreal, from PrEBi and Conferences Portal of National University of La Plata
(http://prebi.unlp.edu.ar and http://congresos.unlp.edu.ar), and it's distributed under the GNU GPL v2. For full terms see the file docs/COPYING. Use under your own risk,
no warranty provided.
